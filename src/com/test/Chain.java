public class Chain {
    // Coding Question
    // Given an array of strings A[ ], determine if the strings can be chained together to form a circle. A
    // string X can be chained together with another string Y if the last character of X is same as first
    // character of Y. If every string of the array can be chained, it will form a circle.
    // For eg for the array arr[] = {"for", "geek", "rig", "kaf"} the answer will be Yes as the given strings can be chained as "for", "rig", "geek" and "kaf"
    // Input
    // abc bcd cdf
    // ab bc cd da
